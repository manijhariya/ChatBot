## ChatBot for general chat 

* Created this project to give a features to machine and make them able to talk like a human being with human being capabilities and more...
* Collected data from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/rajathmc/cornell-moviedialog-corpus
* Built a client interactive feature to use ChatBot

## Code and Resources Used

* Python Version 3.7
* Packages : Numpy, Keras

## How ??
The goal is to build a generic ChatBot. Which can talk to humans as a much as like human. ChatBot has a interactive command line to talk to bot as 
you talk to your friends on messanger and other popular social media apps. 

As i was taking classes on udemy for my Natural Language Processing (NLP). I have been build ChatBot with much of code help from my instructor. ChatBot
uses a different set of data to train on which was quite a practice to clean it.

ChatBot trained and tested wih  "85.2%" of accuracy with no abusing and biased words

## File Structure
**bot.py/**           file contains all necessary class function required for bot to run
**botmodel.py/**      file contains all necessary class function required for model to build for bot
**botpredict.py/**    file contains all necessary class function required for bot to predict for new or in direct run to predict
**vocab.py/**         file to make vocabulary from data set
