## ChatBot for general chat 

* Created this project to give a features to machine and make them able to talk like a human being with human being capabilities and more...
* Collected data from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/rajathmc/cornell-moviedialog-corpus
* Built a client interactive feature to use ChatBot

## Code and Resources Used

* Python Version 3.7
* Packages : Numpy, Keras

## How ??
The goal is to build a generic ChatBot. Which can talk to humans as a much as like human. ChatBot has a interactive command line to talk to bot as 
you talk to your friends on messanger and other popular social media apps. 

As i was taking classes on udemy for my Natural Language Processing (NLP). I have been build ChatBot with much of code help from my instructor. ChatBot
uses a different set of data to train on which was quite a practice to clean it.

ChatBot trained and tested wih  "85.2%" of accuracy with no abusing and biased words

## File Structure
bot.py           file contains all necessary class function required for bot to run 
botmodel.py      file contains all necessary class function required for model to build for bot
botpredict.py    file contains all necessary class function required for bot to predict for new or in direct run to predict
vocab.py         file to make vocabulary from data set
